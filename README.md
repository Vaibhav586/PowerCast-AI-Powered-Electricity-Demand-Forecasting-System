# AI-Powered Electricity Demand Forecasting System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced AI-based electricity demand forecasting model, addressing key challenges in predicting electricity consumption and peak load in Delhi. The model leverages historical data, AI techniques, and dynamic adaptability to enhance power purchase and distribution planning.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Aggregates historical load data, weather, holiday, and urban development data.
- **AI Model Development**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms, including time-series forecasting, regression models, and neural networks (LSTM), to predict demand patterns.
- **Peak Load Forecasting**: Incorporates peak load prediction for more accurate power procurement strategies.
- **Compensation Methodology**: Adjusts forecasts for real-time fluctuations using advanced algorithms.

## How It Solves the Problem
- **Accurate Forecasting**: Ensures alignment between power procurement and actual electricity demand.
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Handles fluctuations in demand, considering factors like holidays and urban development.
- **Holistic Approach**: Provides a comprehensive forecast that factors in seasonal and daily variations for better planning.

## Technical Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Historical load data, weather conditions, and holiday information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
3. **Model Development**: Start with baseline models (Linear Regression, ARIMA), then advance to LSTM and ensemble methods.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Optimize using RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
5. **Model Deployment**: API-based real-time predictions and a visualization dashboard for monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI/Tableau, Flask/FastAPI
- **Deployment Platforms**: AWS, GCP, or Azure
